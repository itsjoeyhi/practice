Practice breaking it down! Choose one of the following to explain as if the listener has never done it before:

What are the steps involved in making a phone call?

listen to dial tone =>dial 10 digit number (us)=>wait for receiving end to answer=> if no answer, leave voicemail if it's set up

In our “Say Hi” example, if the Say Hi part of the program never runs, how would you narrow down the cause of the problem? Explain the process and use a roadmap to visualize it.

I would work backwards and follow it back until we identify where the issue started. Also I would follow the steps backwards until we find the last step that worked correctly

username input=>user button click=> say Hi
 

Create a problem-solving example using a roadmap and the process of elimination for narrowing down issues of your own. You already use this skill daily. Break down and explain a problem you solve in your everyday life.
